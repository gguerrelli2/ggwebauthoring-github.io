	<h2>Description</h2>
	<p>This is a disc of the game Disney Infinity for the Nintendo Wii. It measures 12 centimeters in diameter. The disc features seventeen of the game’s playable Disney characters with the Disney Infinity logo on a white background. It has a smooth finish on the front with a shiny back side. It has a plastic feel to it.</p>
	
	<p>I acquired the item from my boyfriend, who brought it to me so we could play the game together. He had used the disc to play the game during his childhood. Unfortunately, when I put the disc into my Wii, the Wii stated that the disc could not be read. We tried reinserting the disc several times, but the closest we got to playing the game was seeing the title screen.</p>
		
	<p>We gave up after a while and concluded that the disc was broken, so I decided to part ways with it shortly after.</p>
	
	<h2>Anecdote</h2>
	<p>After seeing a reference to Disney Infinity online, my boyfriend and I wanted to revisit the game. I was in my room at my apartment with him when he showed me that he had brought his Disney Infinity disc with him. We were curious to see if the old disc would still read on my Wii. When we put it in, it appeared to have worked. However, when we hit Play, we encountered a black screen saying that the disc could not be read. Disappointed, we took the disc back out. We wiped the back of the disc and put it back in the Wii to try again. We were only able to watch the opening cutscene before we were met with the black screen again. We tried two more times with no further success. We figured the disc was scratched and that we would be unable to play, so we gave up on trying.</p>

<h3>Wii Lens </h3>
	<p>While it is likely that the disc itself is scratched, the Wii actually has a lens inside of it that it used to read games. It can be removed and cleaned or replaced.</p>
